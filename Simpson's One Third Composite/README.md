
# Composite Simpson's 1/3 Rule

## Summary
- A method that approximates the area under a curve in accordance with the level of accuracy desired by the user.
- In other words, how many inputs values the user desires.
- Uses trapezoidal rule if an odd number of segmetns exist in the input matrices.
- Trapezoidal rule is only applied to the last two values of the matrix.

## Input
1. (x) A matrix that stores all the x values that are to be analyzed.
2. (y) A matrix that stores all of the y values that are to be analyzed.
## Output
1. (I) The integrated value that is predicted as the area under the curve.
