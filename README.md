# MECH105-Algorithms
- Algorithms created  using different numerical methods.
---
## LU Factorization
- Factorization method that displays a L, U, and P matrix.
---
## Simpson's 1/3 Rule
- Code that allows us to solve the composite 1/3 rule with any size of given segments.
- Trapezoidal rule used if odd number of segemnts exist in table of values.
---
## False Position
- Root finding method that finds a secant line between two points.
- Where the line crosses the x axis is the new xr. 
- The left or right vlaue is replaced to whichever has the same sign matching xr.
